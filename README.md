# Wanna-Chill-With-365-Permissions-Management-
I have made a program that will make the life of IT guys much more easier, you are more than welcomed to use it .

After you connect to exchange, you can type user without the domain :)
Those permissions are available only on CALENDAR AND CONTACTS.
You have two options one on Hebrew and one on English.

In Hebrew file you can use English and Hebrew, if you have any problem using it try to change in control>region
the format and system locale language to Hebrew.

Feel free to use it.
